# fsckit/unfsckit

This is a work-in-progress, proof-of-concept digital modulation loosely inspired by LoRa[1], which has some properties desirable for acoustic comms over unreliable channels. Care will need to be taken to ensure that we do not violate the LoRa patent if using anything similar to this for anything important. There is lots of relevant stuff in the academic literature describing how to time-align LoRa. I have not read the LoRa patent itself.

## Concepts

### Frequency-shifted chirp keying

The basic concept is identical to multiple-frequency-shift-keying (MFSK) with an additional linearly-increasing-with-wraparound component to the transmitted waveform. Each message starts with a preamble consisting of 2 or more upsweeps followed by 2 downsweeps, allowing the receiver to detect the beginning of a message and simulateously disambiguate timing and carrier frequency offset[2].

Adding the chirped component to MFSK modulation also ensures that all symbols equally sweep the entire passband, providing resilience against non-flat responses in the transmitter, propagation channel, and/or receiver.

### MFSK detection

Once thus synced, the receiver can simply de-chirp the received signal by multiplication with a conjugate of the expected unmodulated chirp sequence. The output of this de-chirping is simple MFSK modulation, which can be optimally[1] decoded using block-wise fast Fourier transforms on a critically sampled subband - that is, each symbol consists of S complex samples, over which a length-S complex-to-complex FFT is performed. The loudest of the resulting S bins is the index of the encoded data symbol, after removing Gray coding such that single-shift errors are always single-bit errors.

Suboptimal demodulation in the high-SNR limit can be performed without an FFT by doing simple FM demodulation of the dechirped waveform within each symbol period.

If the next-downstream logic is a soft-decision forward error correcting decoder, the individual bits can be soft-decided as follows. The dechirping and FFT is performed as before. For each output bit, a power-if-one and a power-if-zero accumulator are initialized. The magnitude squared of the FFT bins of all shifts are inspected. For each bin whose Gray-coded index is set, that bin's magnitude squared is added to the power-if-one accumulator, otherwise it is added to the power-if-zero accumulator. After summing the power in all bins into one or the other of these accumulators, a soft decision between +1.0 and -1.0 can be obtained by dividing the different of these accumulators by their sum. The details of the normalizations of this method have not yet been proven to be optimal.

### Spreading factor

This modulation falls under the category of "spread spectrum" techniques in that there is a knob that controls spectral redundancy. Since each symbol encodes one of S unique values (and therefore, N = log2(S) bits) and has a duration linearly proportional to S, the redundancy factor is S / log2(S), or equivalently, 2^N / N. Values of N of interest to us range from 4 to 6 (compare to LoRa which uses values of N from 7 to 12 inclusive, in 125-500 kHz of bandwidth around 1 GHz).

### Forward error correction

The current implementation uses a Hamming 7,4 code with no interleaving, and does a dumb simple exhaustive naive maximum-likelihood brute force search for the most likely uncorrupted code word using soft bit decisions as inputs. We can probably do better, but bear in mind this needs to work on a microcontroller with almost no available memory.

### Todo

- Better false alarm mitigation. This will require both better resistance to incorrectly leaving the detecting-a-preamble state, as well as a way to quickly return to it rather than demodulating a long data packet that does not exist. A checksum on the packet length might be most surefire way to achieve this, at the expense of adding overhead to every packet

- Improve preamble detection at low SNR

- Determine the minimum necessary amount of bandpass filtering in actual practice - the eight-pole Butterworth bandpass filter downstream of the high pass filter may be overkill

- Identify and eliminate slow libc calls. The code has a number of remainderf() and lrintf() calls within the hot loop which can be a bottleneck or not, depending on how well they are implemented and optimized for the finite-math-only case within various libc's we care about.

- Figure out what is covered by the patent and make sure we are in the clear

- Better forward error correction

- Better routine for identifying two clean downsweeps and the immediately preceding clean upsweep in the preamble. This will require slightly more buffering. An implementation which is suboptimal in memory usage but still achieves optimal output results is probably desirable as it is less likely to step on the LoRa patent, wherein 2.25 downsweeps are used, presumably to enable some memory savings in a particular receiver design.
